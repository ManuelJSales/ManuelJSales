Everybody? Anybody? Well, let’s be honest, this project isn’t going to make you win, but it is a fun optimization problem! And that’s really the point in this class.\n","\n","Imagine that we were interested in joining one of the Draftkings’ National Basketball Association (NBA) contests on Feb 22, 2024. There were 12 real NBA games played amongst 24 teams. The fantasy contest involves selecting a collection of players (a lineup) in these 12 games and you “play” against other people that (potentially) selected different lineups. The winner of the contest is the person whose team accumulated the most fantasy points. The fantasy points are accumulated according to a set of rules (see Figure 1) that are related to how the players perform in their real-life games. Selecting a lineup is subject to a fictitious salary cap and several additional constraints that are outlined below. The goal of this project is to select an “optimal” lineup. What is “optimal?” That is for you to decide!  \n","\n","Data\n","Here are the data that you need to solve this problem.\n","- \tDKSalaries.csv – Data from Draftkings website including player names, teams, salary, position, and average points per game.\n","- Actual game data from Feb 22, 2024\n","    - XXX.csv – Data from each of the 12 games on Feb 22 related to the players.\n","- Season Statistics\n","    - PlayerStats.csv – Data from the NBA season (October 24, 2023 through Feb 21, 2024)\n","\n","Objectives:\n","1.\tUse python to apply optimization models and solution techniques learned in class to solve a real-world problem.\n","2.\tYou will have to do some exploratory data analysis using the historical data to carefully consider your objective function coefficients.\n","3.\tYou will solve at least two optimization problems for this project:\n","\n","  a.\tOne problem will involve selecting a lineup based on historical information. Tell me what your strategy was in choosing players, and how it would outperform the naïve strategy of picking just based on average daily points.  Perhaps older players will play better than they averaged because these players had a lot of rest?  Maybe players do better at home than on the road?  Maybe players do better if they are playing against a bad team, or worse if they are playing against a good team? Maybe you want to pick people who are on the same team, because if one player is scoring, his teammate might be getting the assist?  If you don’t know anything about basketball, use Google (or your favorite AI)!\n","\n","  b.\tThe second problem will involve selecting the optimal lineup based on how the players performed during their actual games (i.e., the “cheat code” if you had it prior to selecting your lineup.\n","\n","4.\tWrite a report summarizing your results.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nChps9Iyh97J"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Downloading and Importing Packages\n","We will be using pandas, pyomo, matplotlib, and unicode data for this model.

Additionally, I realized it did not do the last given constraint about UTIL players. I asked about it and it said that you indirectly meet this constraints through the rest of the position constraints. I compared my constraints to other classmates and they had a completely different approach. Many split players with more than 1 position into two different ones, which I believe forced to create that last constraint. My lineups displayed players that were able to meet this constraint without having to explicitely declare it, which I think is interesting if is correct.\n","\n","I also realized the approach to loading data into a master dataframe is genius.
